            Adytum is a cryptic online game, where players solve puzzles to advance through rooms and collect codes.   
            The entire structure of the game is a cluster of rooms that are connected to other rooms on four ends through doors.
            Each room consists of a question which on solving gives the user a key. The key will be used to open the doors to 
            special rooms. These rooms will give codes for the final puzzle. Out of all the rooms, there will be some rooms that 
            will give special keys that will lead to the final puzzle. Solving this puzzle will lead to the Adytum (the sacred 
            sanctum). We feel like this is a unique idea, and will provide users with a fun, challenging way to enjoy themselves, 
            while improving their problem solving abilities.
